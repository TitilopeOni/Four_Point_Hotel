Project 1.

ETL Process

Step 1. Extract
Extracted the 5 csv files on Power BI/SQL viz:
bookings, food orders, menu, requests and rooms which are all data extracts from A hotel system 

Step 2. Transform- Inspect/Understand/Clean/Normalise data


a. Observations:
i. There were no duplicate or null values in all the data sets. However, in the bookings table, 3 IDs i.e, 1Ds 1919, 6456 and 9516 Table had both start dates and end dates as year 1916 instead of year 2016. 
id	room	start date	end date	request id
1919	L11	1/7/1916	1/17/1916	938
6456	S91	2/29/1916	3/9/1916	3101
9516	X75	3/1/1916	3/3/1916	4604

b. So click on each date to find and replace by the appropriate date in year 2016.

c. Understanding the data;
The dataset being analysed is that of A Hotel providing Room bookings, Conferences and restaurant services to its customers. The data spans for a period of 4 months with start date at 1/1/2016 and end date at 4/7/2016 for food orders; 1/1/2016 and end date at 4/13/2016, for bookings and requests. The frequency of the data is daily (i.e data is collected/recorded daily) 

d.Transform data on Power Query Editor 

Step 3. Load the 5 Tables by clicking Close and Apply.

4. Given that this is a Relational Database a quick look at the model view on Power BI gives a quick view of the relationships between the tables viz:
5. Designing the ER Diagram
1. Given that there are 5 entities and thus 5 Tables.


a. Starting from independent to dependent
-RequestTable: The relationship between request and booking is 1 to many; implying that one request can have many books.
          Common Column is request ID
          
-BookingsTable: The relationship between Bookings and room is 1 to 1; implying a booking to a room
           Foreign key Request ID (already created)
           Common column is Room ID (Create room ID as foreign key to replace/indicate room type/prefix)
-RoomsTable: The relationship between Rooms and food orders is 

6. Joining the Tables

7. Business Intelligence 
1. Which request type is the most profitable
2. Which request type is complementary to the restuarant i.e serves as leads to the restaurant arm of the business
3. Which month and day of the week is pick period?
4. which room type is more prefered and more profitable
5. Any repeat customer?
6. What is the longest booking/reservation period?
7. Which Menu category is most profitable?
8. Which Menu category is complementary?
